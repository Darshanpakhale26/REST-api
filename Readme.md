# üõ†Ô∏è RESTful API with Node.js, Express & File System

This project is a simple and educational RESTful API built using **Node.js** and **Express.js**. It performs complete **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations using a local JSON file (`users.json`) to simulate a database. It's perfect for learning backend basics without needing a full database setup.
